☀️ Task 3: Cross-Country Solar Potential Comparison
📘 Overview

This notebook (compare_countries.ipynb) performs a cross-country analysis of solar potential across Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo, using cleaned solar irradiance datasets.
The goal is to compare key solar metrics (GHI, DNI, DHI), identify significant differences between countries, and summarize actionable insights for solar energy planning.
